Hey there! I'm **Yijin Zhao** (赵一瑾), but you can call me **Zoe** or **Aoki**—whichever feels right! 😊

Here's a little peek into my world:

- **Pet Status:** 🐕 Maximum dogs in my house: 1. 🐈 Maximum cats in my house: 10. (Yes, you read that right—I'm basically a cat whisperer!)
- **Hobbies & Skills:** 🎹 I can play piano and violin. 🎿 I love skiing and skating. (Basically, I'm a musical athlete!)
- **Gaming Queen:** 🎮 I play games *very* well and have a top rank in China! (No big deal... 😎)
- **Adventurous Spirit:** 🌟 I love trying new things—bring on the challenges!
- **Culinary Magic:** 🍳 I've been cooking delicious food for years. (Your taste buds can thank me later.)
- **K-Pop Vibes:** 🎤 My favorite bands in 2026: Girls—**BLACKPINK**! Boys—**Cortis**! (Let's stan together! 💖)
- **Social Style:** 🤝 I enjoy quiet solo time to do my own thing, but I also love chatting with fun people. (It's all about balance!)
- **Passions:** 💡 I enjoy helping others and improving on old stuff to make it better. (Why fix what's not broken? Because *better* is always possible!)
- **Goal:** 🔍 I want to focus more on details in my life. (The little things matter!)
